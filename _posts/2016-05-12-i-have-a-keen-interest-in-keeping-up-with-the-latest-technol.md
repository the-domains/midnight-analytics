description: "I have a keen interest in keeping up with the latest technologies. When I was born, TV was still black and white - no remote, no color, mostly \"snow\" (wavy horizontal lines instead of a picture). I spent much time trying to figure out how the people got into the TV set. I remember seeing a TV that was no longer working and the TV tube had been removed. I ran to the TV to see if I could figure out where the people were. I know this sounds crazy on so many levels but, remember, I was only four years old. Anyway, I'm excited to be a part of this new website creation technology and I can't wait to see the magic happen."
